      <p>Crits are a good place to discuss work with other designers to help solve design issues. A larger crit session is organised once every two weeks but informal crits are recommended whenever the need arises, they should include at least 3 designers.</p>

        <p>If the user need or design solution is new and there's no pattern that resolves the issue, add it to the patterns board and we will review with you so it can be developed to help others.</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>Include what the problem the pattern is trying to solve</li>
